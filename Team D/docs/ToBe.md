# Modern Application Design Document

## Overview

The modernized application will be a scalable web-based solution, leveraging modern technologies and cloud-based services. It will maintain the same functionalities as the existing application but with improvements in scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: AWS

## Frontend Design

The frontend will be built using React.js. The application will be composed of reusable React components, improving the maintainability of the code. React's virtual DOM will ensure the UI is highly performant.

- **Login Component**: Handles user authentication. 
- **Main Component**: Includes different panels (Customers, Suppliers, Products, Orders, Invoices, Accounting, User Accounts) depending on the user level. Each panel will be a separate React component.

## Backend Design

The backend will be built using Node.js, following a microservices architecture. Each microservice will be responsible for a specific functionality, improving scalability and maintainability.

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Customer Service**: Handles all operations related to customers.
- **Supplier Service**: Handles all operations related to suppliers.
- **Product Service**: Handles all operations related to products.
- **Order Service**: Handles all operations related to orders.
- **Invoice Service**: Handles all operations related to invoices.
- **Accounting Service**: Handles all operations related to accounting.
- **User Account Service**: Handles all operations related to user accounts.

## Database Design

MongoDB will be used as the database. It's a NoSQL database, so it can handle a variety of data types and is easily scalable.

- **Users Collection**: Stores user information, including username, password (hashed), and user level.
- **Customers Collection**: Stores customer information.
- **Suppliers Collection**: Stores supplier information.
- **Products Collection**: Stores product information.
- **Orders Collection**: Stores order information, including associated products and supplier.
- **Invoices Collection**: Stores invoice information.
- **Accounting Collection**: Stores accounting information.

## Deployment Design

The application will be deployed on AWS. AWS's Elastic Beanstalk service can be used to handle the deployment and scaling of the application.

## Data Migration Strategy

Data migration from the existing system to the new system will be a critical aspect of this modernization. Here's a proposed strategy:

1. **Data Assessment**: Understand the structure, type, and interdependencies of the current data.

2. **Schema Design**: Design the schema for MongoDB collections based on the data assessment.

3. **Migration Script**: Develop a script to migrate data from the current system to MongoDB. This might involve data transformation to match the new schema.

4. **Test Migration**: Conduct a test migration on a non-production environment to identify and fix potential issues.

5. **Actual Migration**: Once everything is tested, perform the actual data migration. This might involve some system downtime.

6. **Verification**: After migration, verify if the data has been correctly migrated and the application is working as expected.

## Scalability, Security, and Maintainability

- **Scalability**: The microservices architecture, along with the scalability features provided by AWS and MongoDB, will ensure the application can handle a large number of users and requests.

- **Security**: User passwords will be hashed before storing. HTTPS will be used to secure data in transit. AWS's security features will be used to secure the application and data.

- **Maintainability**: The use of React and Node.js, along with the microservices architecture, will ensure the codebase remains maintainable. Proper testing and documentation will further improve maintainability.
